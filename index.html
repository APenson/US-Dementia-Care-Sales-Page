            <div class="subtitle">Your Complete 4-Step Guide to Quality Dementia Care in Her Own Home</div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p><strong>If you're reading this, you're probably facing one of the most heartbreaking decisions a family can face.</strong></p>
            
            <p>You've watched the person you love struggle with dementia. You've seen the confusion in their eyes, felt helpless during the difficult moments, and lost sleep worrying about their safety. Now someone has mentioned "putting them in a home," and your heart breaks a little more.</p>

            <div class="stats">
                <p><strong>You're not alone in feeling overwhelmed:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>$373,527</strong> - Average annual cost of dementia care in America</li>
                    <li><strong>83%</strong> of help provided to older adults comes from unpaid family caregivers</li>
                    <li><strong>61%</strong> of dementia caregivers report high emotional stress</li>
                    <li><strong>$108,405</strong> - Average annual nursing home cost vs. <strong>$61,776</strong> for quality home care</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>But here's what most families don't realize: <strong>Quality home care isn't just more compassionate—it's often more affordable when you know how to navigate America's complex healthcare system.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Problem: America's Healthcare Maze</h2>
            <p>Unlike families in other countries who can simply call their national health service, American families must piece together a complex puzzle of Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and Veterans benefits—each with different rules, coverage limits, and application processes.</p>

            <p>Most families make costly mistakes because they don't understand:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>What Medicare actually covers for dementia home care (hint: it's more than you think)</li>
                <li>How Medicaid waiver programs can pay for comprehensive home services</li>
                <li>Which Veterans benefits provide up to $2,431/month for home care expenses</li>
                <li>How to coordinate multiple funding sources for maximum coverage</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="testimonial">
                "I assumed Medicare wouldn't cover home care because everyone said it only covers skilled nursing. I was wrong. We got 8 weeks of covered services that saved us over $12,000, and it gave us time to set up a sustainable long-term plan."

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">This proven system has helped hundreds of families navigate from crisis to quality home care in 30 days or less</p>
            
            <div class="step">

            <div class="step">
                <h4>Step 4: Long-term Success and Benefits Management (Ongoing)</h4>

                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Middle-class family with modest assets, caring for Maria (82) with vascular dementia. Making too much for Medicaid but nowhere near enough for private care at $5,000-7,000 monthly.</p>
                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Using the 4-Step System, they accessed Texas's Community Based Alternatives waiver program.</p>
                <p><strong>Result:</strong> $3,200/month in Medicaid coverage for comprehensive home care, plus both adults kept their jobs and health insurance.</p>

            <p>Your loved one deserves to remain in the comfort and dignity of their own home. You deserve to stop feeling overwhelmed and start feeling confident about the care decisions you're making.</p>

            <h2>Don't Wait Until It's Too Late</h2>
            <p>Every day families tell themselves they'll "figure it out later" or wait until the situation becomes a crisis. But by then, your options become limited and more expensive.</p>

            <p><strong>The families who succeed are those who take action before they're forced to.</strong> They're the ones who have systems in place, who understand their options, and who can make informed decisions instead of desperate ones.</p>

            <p>Six months from now, you can either be managing a successful home care situation with confidence and peace of mind, or you can still be struggling with the same overwhelming questions you have today.</p>

            <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; font-size: 1.2rem; font-weight: bold;">The choice is yours. Your loved one is counting on you to make it.</p>
